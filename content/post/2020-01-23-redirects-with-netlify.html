<p>I recently saw this tweet from <a href="https://djnavarro.net">Danielle Navarro</a> about
purchasing a domain to serve redirects to important links.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">
Possibly the most ridiculous thing I've spent $14/year onâ€¦ buying <a href="https://djnavarro.link">djnavarro.link</a> so that I can have my own personal link shortening service. Because <a href="https://djnavarro.link/scholar">djnavarro.link/scholar</a><br><br>is a much nicer link to my Google Scholar profile and at least I can remember the damn thing

<p>What a great idea!
Iâ€™m pretty sure I will never memorize
<a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4648-654X" class="uri">https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4648-654X</a>, so it would be nice to have something
easier to share.
But, I donâ€™t want to purchase a separate domain.

<p>Fear not, <a href="https://robjhyndman.com">Rob J Hyndman</a> notes that netlify has an
easy way to setup redirects from your domain!</p>

I think netlify can do something similar. See <a href="https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects">docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects</a>

<p>Letâ€™s see if I can get this to work!
According to the netlify documentation, there are two ways to do redirects.
One is fairly simple, but less powerful.
I like simple, so Iâ€™ll go with that.</p>
<p>Here are the steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Create the following file: <code>static/_redirects</code></p></li>
<li><p>Fill it with urls like so:</p>
<pre><code># Redirect from yourdomain.com*, to url
/orcid        https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4648-654X
/researchgate https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Eric_Bryant
/twitter      https://twitter.com/EricBryantPhD
/github       https://github.com/EricBryantPhD</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<p>Now, I can share my ORCID profile with
<a href="https://ericbryantphd.com/orcid">ericbryantphd.com/orcid</a>.
ðŸ¥³</p>
<p>Of course, the downside of this is that it isnâ€™t really clear that these links
will redirect, which is not very transparent (i.e.Â kinda rude actually) as
noted by Danielle:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">
I kind of like it. I really like the fact that there's some transparency to the process because it's a .link domain. <br><br>Anything at <a href="https://djnavarro.net">djnavarro.net</a> is my own website, anything at <a href="https://djnavarro.link">djnavarro.link</a> goes elsewhere ðŸ™‚

<p>For this use case though, I think it is fairly clear that e.g.
<a href="https://ericbryantphd.com/orcid">ericbryantphd.com/orcid</a> will take you to a
page having something to do with ORCID, and e.g.
<a href="https://ericbryantphd.com/github">ericbryantphd.com/github</a> will take you to
a page having something to do with GitHub, so Iâ€™m sticking to it!</p>
